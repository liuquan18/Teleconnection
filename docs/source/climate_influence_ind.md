### violin plot

Fig 3. **More negative extreme North Atlanci Osciilation and East Atlantic pattern.** Violin plots of North Atlantic Oscillation (left) and East Atlantic pattern (right) in the first10 years (blue) and last10 years (orange) at all altitudes.

## 2. Increased count of negative extreme cases
We define the cases above (below) the 2std as the extreme events. The count of the extreme cases over different altitudes are shown as following: NAO shows clear increased negative extremes, the count of positive extreme stays the same. EA shows similiar result as NAO, but not so clear over lower altitudes.

### NAO vertical Profile

Fig 4. **Raised negative extremes of North Atlantic Oscillation in a warmer climate.** Vertical profile of extreme counts of North Atlantic Oscillation at all altitudes in the first10 (solid) and last10 (dashed) years. the last column shows the difference.

### EA vertical profile

Fig 5. The same as Fig 4, but for East Atlantic pattern. 


## 4. return period of extremes

**Extreme Value Theory** provides another way to check the extremeness of the index.
Since the index among ensemble domain are Indentical Independent Distributed, the idea of "Block Maximum" of Extreme Value Theory can be extended to ensemble domain. i.e, the maximum along ensemble should also fit to the extreme distribution.
### 4.1 The return period of NAO and EA at 500hpa.

Fig 7 The return period of EA index in the first10 (blue) and last10 (red) years.


### 4.2 the median return period vertical profile
