The paper focuses on the following scientific question: How does global warming influence the internal variability of teleconnection modes like the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and East Atlantic (EA) pattern, in terms of extreme states? Since we only focus on the internal variability, the externally forced signal is removed beforehand. The global warmingâ€™s influence on internal variability of NAO and EA is then represented as the difference between the last 10 years and the first 10 years in the 1% CO_2 run. 

To ensure the robustness, the spatial pattern are decomposed with EOF analysis over all the temporal_ensemble fields (that's 150*100 samples), hereafter referred as "all_pattern". Then the indexes are generated by projecting the geopotential height data onto the all_pattern. Here shows the statistics of standardized indexes (with temporal_ens_mean and std).

## 1. More negative extreme NAO and EA in a warmer climate
PDF and violin plots show obvious increased negative extremes.

## 2. Increased count of negative extreme cases
We define the cases above (below) the 2std as the extreme events. The count of the extreme cases over different altitudes are shown as following: NAO shows clear increased negative extremes, the count of positive extreme stays the same. EA shows similiar result as NAO, but not so clear over lower altitudes.

## 3. The extreme spatial patterns
composite analysis of geopotential height data in terms of different extreme types and different periods shows the change in spatial patterns of extreme cases.
For **NAO**, positive extreme shows tripole pattern in the last10 years, compared to dipole pattern in the first10 years. negative extremes shows typical NAO spatial patterns, but strengthened in amplitude. The clear pattern change of NAO positive extremes may correspond to the non-obvious change of extreme positive extreme counts. Thus, dynamical patterns to generate the index are also excuted. 
For **EA**, both positive and negative extremes show eastward shifts, such shifts are more obvious if dynamical spatial patterns are adopted.
