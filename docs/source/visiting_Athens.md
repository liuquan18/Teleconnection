The paper focuses on the following scientific question: How does global warming influence the internal variability of teleconnection modes like the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and East Atlantic (EA) pattern, in terms of extreme states? Since we only focus on the internal variability, the externally forced signal is removed beforehand. The global warming’s influence on internal variability of NAO and EA is then represented as the difference between the last 10 years and the first 10 years in the 1% CO_2 run. 

To ensure the robustness, the spatial pattern are decomposed with EOF analysis over all the temporal_ensemble fields (that's 150*100 samples), and all vetical altitudes (Horizontal_vetival EOF), hereafter referred as "all_pattern". Then the indexes are generated by projecting the geopotential height data onto the "all_pattern". Here shows the statistics of standardized indexes (with temporal_ens_mean and _std).

## 1. More negative extreme NAO and EA in a warmer climate
PDF and violin plots show obvious increased negative extremes.

## 2. Increased count of negative extreme cases
We define the cases above (below) the 2std as the extreme events. The count of the extreme cases over different altitudes are shown as following: NAO shows clear increased negative extremes, the count of positive extreme stays the same. EA shows similiar result as NAO, but not so clear over lower altitudes.

## 4. return period of extremes

**Extreme Value Theory** provides another way to check the extremeness of the index.
Since the index among ensemble domain are Indentical Independent Distributed, the idea of "Block Maximum" of Extreme Value Theory can be extended to ensemble domain. i.e, the maximum along ensemble should also fit to the extreme distribution.
### 4.1 The return period of NAO and EA at 500hpa.

## 5. The extreme spatial patterns
composite analysis of geopotential height data in terms of different extreme types and different periods shows the change in spatial patterns of extreme cases.

For **NAO**, positive extreme shows tripole pattern in the last10 years, compared to dipole pattern in the first10 years. negative extremes shows typical NAO spatial patterns, but strengthened in amplitude. The clear pattern change of NAO positive extremes may correspond to the non-obvious change of extreme positive extreme counts. Thus, dynamical patterns to generate the index are also excuted. 
For **EA**, both positive and negative extremes show eastward shifts, such shifts are more obvious if dynamical spatial patterns are adopted.

## 6. Effects of increased extreme events of teleconnections

Does such kind of change matter? Here we do the composite analysis of temperature and precipitation in terms of different extreme types.

**Surface temperature - NAO extreme types**

Composite analysis of surface temperature in terms of different NAO extreme types. The last column shows the difference. 

![NAO_temp](plots/wrap_up_aftervoc/NAO_temp.png)
Fig 12. **Less warming over Northern Eurasia in winter.** composite analsysis of surface temperature in terms of different extreme types (rows) and different periods (first 2 cols). The last columns shows the difference.

for NAO extremes, the influence of positive extremes (warm anomalies over northern Eurasia) gets weaker in the last 10 years. The influence of negative extreme events (cold anomalies over northern Eurasia) gets stronger in the last 10 years. Overall, both positive and negative extremes of NAO lead to less warming over northern Eurasia and the adjacent polar regions. 

![EA_temp](plots/wrap_up_aftervoc/EA_TEMP.png)
For EA extremes, both the influences of positive extremes (warm anomalies over Eurasia) and negative extremes (cold anomalies over Eurasia) extend eastward to East Asia. 
Fig 13. **Cooling extends to east Eurasia.** Same as Fig 8. but for East Atlantic pattern.
