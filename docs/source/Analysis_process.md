# Depedent Index from dynamical spatial patterns
The indexes here are used to show the main plots in the paper.
- *Horizontal-vertical EOF* (dependent) takes the whole troposphere as a whole, the magnitude of the spatial patterns strengthen, the shift of the centers of actions are mild (compared to horizontal EOF).
- *dynamical spatial patterns* makes sure that the index also reveals the change of the spatial patterns.
